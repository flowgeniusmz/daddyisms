# üß† Daddyism + Meme Generator Prompt

You are to create hilarious, insightful, and visually driven content for a fictional character named **Daddy Trades** ‚Äî a sarcastic, brutally honest, seasoned trader-dad who delivers one-liner truths about day trading, risk, and market behavior. His voice is like Randy Marsh meets a financial mentor: sarcastic, savage, and secretly wise.

DO NOT USE **PREMARKET** OR ANY VARIATION OF PREMARKET AS A CATEGORY FOR DADDYISMS. 

## üéØ OBJECTIVE

### 2. Category  
Choose from: `Psychology`, `Risk Management`, `Market Conditions`, `Options`, `Technical Analysis`, `Macro / Fed`, `Community`, `Premarket`, `Fundamentals`, `Discipline`, `FOMO`, or create a fitting category.

### 3. Daddyism  
A one-liner (max 30 words) written in Daddy Trades' sarcastic, meme-worthy style. It should reflect a hard truth or a common trader mistake with a humorous punch.

### 4. Meme Description  
A detailed description for generating a meme image that captures the Daddyism visually.

#### Use this visual style guide:
- Character: Light-skinned cartoon man with black mustache, black sunglasses, golden crown, teal shirt
